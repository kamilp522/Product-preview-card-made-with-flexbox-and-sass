## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

There weren't any photos of the actual design on the landscape view on mobile, but I took care of that anyway.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - preprocessor for css

### What I learned

I used this exercise to practice responsive web design and get a better understanding of sass by incomporating it into my project (even though project wasn't big)

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R4fpnIAozs&t=457s&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) - Really nice video explaining how to incomporate media querries into the project while using sass.
